Python Variables

In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value.

Unlike Java and many other languages, Python variables do not require explicit declaration of type.
The type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned.

x = 5
name = "Samantha"  
print(x)
print(name)
Output:

5

Samantha

Rules for Naming Variables
To use variables effectively, we must follow Python’s naming rules:

Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores (_).
A variable name cannot start with a digit.
Variable names are case-sensitive like myVar and myvar are different.
Avoid using Python keywords like if, else, for as variable names.
Valid :


age = 21
_colour = "lilac"
total_score = 90
Invalid :


1name = "Error"  # Starts with a digit
class = 10       # 'class' is a reserved keyword
user-name = "Doe"  # Contains a hyphen
Assigning Values to Variables
Basic Assignment
Variables in Python are assigned values using the = operator.


x = 5
y = 3.14
z = "Hi"
Dynamic Typing
Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning the same variable can hold different types of values during execution.


x = 10
x = "Now a string"
Multiple Assignments
Python allows multiple variables to be assigned values in a single line.

Assigning the Same Value
Python allows assigning the same value to multiple variables in a single line, which can be useful for initializing variables with the same value.


a = b = c = 100
print(a, b, c) 
Output:

100 100 100

Assigning Different Values
We can assign different values to multiple variables simultaneously, making the code concise and easier to read.


x, y, z = 1, 2.5, "Python"
print(x, y, z) 
Output:

1 2.5 Python

Type Casting a Variable
Type casting refers to the process of converting the value of one data type into another. Python provides several built-in functions to facilitate casting, including int(), float() and str() among others.

Basic Casting Functions
int(): Converts compatible values to an integer.
float(): Transforms values into floating-point numbers.
str(): Converts any data type into a string.

s = "10"  
n = int(s) 
cnt = 5
f = float(cnt)  
age = 25
s2 = str(age)  

print(n)  
print(f)  
print(s2)  
Output:

10

5.0

25

Getting the Type of Variable
In Python, we can determine the type of a variable using the type() function. This built-in function returns the type of the object passed to it.


n = 42
f = 3.14
s = "Hello, World!"
li = [1, 2, 3]
d = {'key': 'value'}
bool = True

print(type(n))   
print(type(f)) 
print(type(s))   
print(type(li))     
print(type(d))     
print(type(bool))  
Output:

<class 'int'> 

<class 'float'> 

<class 'str'> 

<class 'list'> 

<class 'dict'> 

<class 'bool'>

Object Reference in Python
Let us assign a variable x to value 5.

x = 5

Object References
When x = 5 is executed, Python creates an object to represent the value 5 and makes x reference this object.

Now, let's assign another variable y to the variable x.

y = x

Object References in Python
Python encounters the first statement, it creates an object for the value 5 and makes x reference it. The second statement creates y and references the same object as x, not x itself. This is called a Shared Reference, where multiple variables reference the same object.
Now, if we write

x = 'Geeks'

Python creates a new object for the value "Geeks" and makes x reference this new object.

Python Variable
The variable y remains unchanged, still referencing the original object 5.

If we now assign a new value to y:

y = "Computer"

Object References in Python
Python creates yet another object for "Computer" and updates y to reference it.
The original object 5 no longer has any references and becomes eligible for garbage collection.
Python variables hold references to objects, not the actual objects themselves.
Reassigning a variable does not affect other variables referencing the same object unless explicitly updated.
Delete a Variable Using del Keyword
We can remove a variable from the namespace using the del keyword. This deletes the variable and frees up the memory it was using.


x = 10
print(x) 
del x
# Trying to print x after deletion will raise an error
# print(x)  # Uncommenting this line will raise NameError: name 'x' is not defined
del x removes the variable x from memory.
After deletion, trying to access the variable x results in a NameError indicating that the variable no longer exists.
Practical Examples
1. Swapping Two Variables
Using multiple assignments, we can swap the values of two variables without needing a temporary variable.


a, b = 5, 10
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)  
Output:

10 5

2. Counting Characters in a String
Assign the results of multiple operations on a string to variables in one line.


word = "Python"
length = len(word)
print("Length of the word:", length) 
Output:

Length of the word: 6

in the #comment, it says 10, but x is assigned to the number 5

age = 25
s2 = str(age)  # Cast integer to string


print(s2)

 

the output should be '25' which is string format and not 25 as int format as it is typecasted from int to string. right?

expected input :10,20

expeted output:"10>5:True,10<5:False,10==20:False,10!=5:True"
